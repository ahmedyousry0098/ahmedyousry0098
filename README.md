# 💫 About Me

💻 **Backend-focused engineer** specialized in **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **NestJS**, and database technologies including **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **elasticsearch**, **prisma**, and **Mongoose**. I build scalable backend systems and RESTful APIs with clean architecture and strong engineering practices.

⚙️ I also have working knowledge of **Golang** and **Java**, which helps me adapt to different backend ecosystems and patterns.

🚀 On the DevOps side, I work comfortably with **Linux**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Ansible**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and cloud services—especially **AWS** (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch).

🎨 While backend is my main focus, I’m also familiar with modern frontend frameworks like **Vue.js**, **React**, and **Angular**, enabling smooth collaboration across the full stack.

🛠 I enjoy designing distributed systems, building caching layers, integrating messaging queues, and optimizing performance. Always learning, always building.
